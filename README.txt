
This "Events Project" is not functional past the login screen. 
Although countless effort has been made to make this fully functional, including the helpful 
opinions from cohort piers and online sites via google searches; All suggestions were 
implemented and unfortunately, some caused other problems to occur that were working prior.
Things simply fell apart the more I tried to put things together or places different files in place. 
All *.hbs files are included w/Handelbars in place. I personally can't state how many hours of debugging were are performed.

FYI, I'm still working on this!! ...or at this point I feel like I'm spinnning my wheels and getting no where.
